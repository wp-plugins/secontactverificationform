== Description ==

SE Contact Verification Form comes with mobile number verification functionality combining OTP (One-Time Password) 
with our Wordpress SE Contact Form. We integrated wordpress contact form with [https://www.isms.com.my/](https://www.isms.com.my/) 
mobile number verification tools to validate all incoming enquiries and prevent spams through SMS. 
SE Contact Verification Form supports CAPTCHA for additional spam filtering and comes with predefined contact form 
fields as well as additional custom text fields. [Bulk SMS from isms.com.my](https://www.isms.com.my/) covers more than 800 mobile operators worldwide,

You can choose to enable/disable the function to have user verify their phone number before allowing them to submit any enquiries. 
Should you choose to enable the SMS verification function in your wordpress contact form, users who wish to send you an enquiry through 
the form will need to have their mobile number verified first. An SMS will be sent to the visitor and he/she will be required to 
insert the pin number (provided in the SMS) into the contact form. For a complete guide on how to setup and configure the plugin, please click [HERE](https://www.isms.com.my/how-to-setup-sms-verification-one-time-password-form-in-wordpress.php).
